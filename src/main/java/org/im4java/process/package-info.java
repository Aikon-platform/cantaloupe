/**
 * <p>This package contains code from the org.im4java.process package of
 * im4java 1.4.0, largely unmodified.</p>
 *
 * <p>The star of the show is {@link org.im4java.process.ProcessStarter}, which
 * provides an abstraction on top of {@link java.lang.ProcessBuilder} for
 * easily invoking commands that read and write from/to streams.</p>
 *
 * <p>This package was forked mainly because im4java appears to have been
 * abandoned (as of late 2016) and its higher-level ImageMagick API was never
 * updated for ImageMagick 7.</p>
