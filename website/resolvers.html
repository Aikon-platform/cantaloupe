<h2>Resolvers</h2>

<p>Resolvers locate a source image based on the image identifier in a request URL. In Java-speak, they take in an identifier and return a File or ReadableByteChannel object from which the corresponding image can be read by a <a href="processors.html">processor</a>.</p>

<p>(This distinction is important because <a href="processors.html#Compatibility">not all processors can work with all resolvers</a>.)</p>

<p>The resolution process can be configured to be <a href="#Static%20Resolver">static</a> &mdash; with all requests using the same resolver &mdash; or <a href="#Dynamic%20Resolvers">dynamic</a>, with images being served from different resolvers depending on their identifier.</p>

<h3 id="Static Resolver">Static Resolver</h3>

<p>By default, the <code>resolver.static</code> configuration key is set to <code>FilesystemResolver</code>, which tells Cantaloupe to use <a href="#FilesystemResolver">FilesystemResolver</a> for all requests. This is simple and works in most scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="Dynamic Resolvers">Dynamic Resolvers</h3>

<p>It is possible to serve images from different sources simultaneously. For example, you may have images some stored on a filesystem, and others stored on Amazon S3. <em>If you can differentiate their sources based on their identifier in code</em> &mdash; either by analyzing the identifier string, or performing some kind of service request &mdash; you can write a simple Ruby function to tell Cantaloupe which resolver to use for a given request.</p>

<p>The script can be named anything, but it must have a <span class="filename">.rb</span> extension. Then, it can be referenced by the <code>resolver.chooser_script</code> option, like:</p>

<pre># Option 1: absolute pathname
resolver.chooser_script = /path/to/functions.rb

# Option 2: filename only; will be expected to be located in the
# same folder as the config file, or the current working directory
resolver.chooser_script = functions.rb
</pre>

<p>This file must contain a module called <code>Cantaloupe</code>, and inside that, a function called <code>get_resolver(identifier)</code>, which takes in an identifier and returns a resolver name (such as FilesystemResolver, HttpResolver, etc.) For example:</p>

<pre># functions.rb

module Cantaloupe
  def self.get_resolver(identifier)
    # Here, you would perform some kind of analysis on `identifier`:
    # analyze it, look it up in a web service or database...
    # and then return the name of the resolver to use to serve it.
    'FilesystemResolver'
  end
end

# Uncomment to test on the command line (`ruby functions.rb`)
# puts Cantaloupe::get_resolver('identifier-to-test')</pre>

<p>See <a href="scripts.html">Custom Scripts</a> for general information about custom scripts in Cantaloupe.</p>

<h3 id="FilesystemResolver">FilesystemResolver</h3>

<p>FilesystemResolver maps a URL identifier to a filesystem path, for retrieving images on a local or attached filesystem.</p>

<p>For images with extensions that are missing or unrecognized, this resolver will check the "magic number" to determine type, which will add some overhead. It is therefore slightly more efficient to serve images with extensions.</p>

<p>FilesystemResolver supports two distinct lookup strategies, defined by the <code>FilesystemResolver.lookup_strategy</code> configuration option.</p>

<h4>BasicLookupStrategy</h4>

<p>BasicLookupStrategy locates images by concatenating a pre-defined path prefix and/or suffix. For example, with the following configuration options set:</p>

<pre># Note trailing slash!
FilesystemResolver.BasicLookupStrategy.path_prefix = /usr/local/images/
FilesystemResolver.BasicLookupStrategy.path_suffix =</pre>

<p>An identifier of <code>image.jpg</code> in the URL will resolve to
<span class="filename">/usr/local/images/image.jpg</span>.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger">Note: it is dangerous to <strong>not</strong> use <code>path_prefix</code>. The shallower the path, the more of the filesystem that will be exposed.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">To prevent arbitrary directory traversal, BasicLookupStrategy will strip out <code>..{path separator}</code> and <code>{path separator}..</code> from identifiers before resolving the path.</div>

<h4 id="FilesystemResolverScriptLookupStrategy">ScriptLookupStrategy</h4>

<p>Sometimes, BasicLookupStrategy will not offer enough control. Perhaps you want to serve images from multiple filesystems, or perhaps your identifiers are opaque and you need to perform a database or web service request to locate the corresponding images. With this lookup strategy, you can tell FilesystemResolver to invoke your own custom Ruby function and capture the pathname it returns.</p>

<p>The script can be named anything, but it must have a <span class="filename">.rb</span> extension. Then, it can be referenced by the <code>FilesystemResolver.ScriptLookupStrategy.script</code> option, like:</p>

<pre># Option 1: absolute pathname
FilesystemResolver.ScriptLookupStrategy.script = /path/to/functions.rb

# Option 2: filename only; will be expected to be located in the
# same folder as the config file, or the current working directory
FilesystemResolver.ScriptLookupStrategy.script = functions.rb
</pre>

<p>This file must contain a module called <code>Cantaloupe</code>, and inside that, a function called <code>get_pathname(identifier)</code>, which takes in an identifier and returns a pathname, if available, or <code>nil</code>, if not. A Solr query, for example, could look like:</p>

<pre># functions.rb
require 'net/http'
require 'cgi'

module Cantaloupe
  def self.get_pathname(identifier)
    uri = 'http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=' +
        CGI.escape('id:"' + identifier + '"') +
        '&amp;fl=pathname_si&amp;wt=ruby'
    uri = URI.parse(uri)

    http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
    request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)
    response = http.request(request)
    return nil if response.code.to_i >= 400

    results = eval(response.body)['response']['docs']
    results.any? ? results.first['pathname_si'] : nil
  end
end

# Uncomment to test on the command line (`ruby functions.rb`)
# puts Cantaloupe::get_pathname('identifier-to-test')</pre>

<p>See <a href="scripts.html">Custom Scripts</a> for general information about custom scripts in Cantaloupe.</p>

<h4>Path Separator</h4>

<p>The IIIF Image API specifications mandate that identifiers in URLs be percent-encoded, which changes slashes to <code>%2F</code>. Some reverse-proxy servers automatically decode this into <code>/</code> before passing on the request. This will cause HTTP 404 errors in Cantaloupe.</p>

<p>If you are unable to configure your reverse proxy to stop decoding slashes, the <code>FilesystemResolver.path_separator</code> configuration option will enable you to use an alternate string as a path separator in an identifier. (Be sure to supply the non-percent-encoded string, and then percent-encode it in URLs if it contains any URL-unsafe characters.)</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="HttpResolver">HttpResolver</h3>

<p>HttpResolver maps a URL identifier to an HTTP resource, for retrieving images from a web server.</p>

<p>It is preferable to use this resolver with source images with recognizable file extensions. For images with an extension that is missing or unrecognizable, it will issue an HTTP HEAD request to the server to check the <code>Content-Type</code> header. If the type cannot be inferred from that, an HTTP 415 response will be returned.</p>

<p>HttpResolver supports two distinct lookup strategies, defined by the <code>HttpResolver.lookup_strategy</code> configuration option.</p>

<h4>BasicLookupStrategy</h4>

<p>BasicLookupStrategy locates images by concatenating a pre-defined URL prefix and/or suffix. For example, with the following configuration options set:</p>

<pre># Note trailing slash!
HttpResolver.url_prefix = http://example.org/images/
HttpResolver.url_suffix =</pre>

<p>An identifier of <code>image.jpg</code> in the URL will resolve to
<span class="filename">http://example.org/images/image.jpg</span>.

<h4>ScriptLookupStrategy</h4>

<p>Sometimes, BasicLookupStrategy will not offer enough control. Perhaps you want to serve images from multiple URLs, or perhaps your identifiers are opaque and you need to run a database or web service request to locate them. With this lookup strategy, you can tell HttpResolver to invoke your own custom Ruby script and capture the URL it returns.</p>

<p>The script can be named anything, but it must have a <span class="filename">.rb</span> extension. Then, it can be referenced by the <code>HttpResolver.ScriptLookupStrategy.script</code> option, like:</p>

<pre># Option 1: absolute pathname
HttpResolver.ScriptLookupStrategy.script = /path/to/functions.rb

# Option 2: filename only; will be expected to be located in the
# same folder as the config file, or the current working directory
HttpResolver.ScriptLookupStrategy.script = functions.rb
</pre>

<p>This file must contain a module called <code>Cantaloupe</code>, and inside that, a function called <code>get_url(identifier)</code>, which takes in an identifier and returns a URL, if available, or <code>nil</code>, if not.</p>

<p>See <a href="scripts.html">Custom Scripts</a> for general information about custom scripts in Cantaloupe, and the <a href="#FilesystemResolverScriptLookupStrategy">FilesystemResolver ScriptLookupStrategy</a> section for an example of a similar script.</p>

<h4>Path Separator</h4>

<p>The IIIF Image API specifications mandate that identifiers in URLs be percent-encoded, which changes slashes to <code>%2F</code>. Some proxy servers automatically decode this into <code>/</code> before passing on the request. This will cause HTTP 404 errors in Cantaloupe.

<p>If you are unable to configure your proxy to stop decoding slashes, the <code>HttpResolver.path_separator</code> configuration option will enable you to use an alternate string as a path separator in an identifier. (Be sure to supply the non-percent-encoded string, and then percent-encode it in URLs if it contains any URL-unsafe characters.)</p>

<h3 id="JdbcResolver">JdbcResolver</h3>

<p>JdbcResolver maps a URL identifier to an RDBMS BLOB field, for retrieving images from a relational database.</p>

<p>Cantaloupe does not include any JDBC drivers, so a driver JAR for the desired database must be obtained separately and saved somewhere on the classpath.</p>

<p>The JDBC connection is initialized by the <code>JdbcResolver.connection_string</code>, <code>JdbcResolver.user</code>, and <code>JdbcResolver.password</code> configuration options. If the user or password are not necessary, they can be left blank. The connection string must use your driver's JDBC syntax:</p>

<pre><code>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/my_database
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_database
jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://example.org:1433;DatabaseName=MY_DATABASE</code></pre>

<p>Consult the driver's documentation for details.</p>

<p>Then, the resolver needs to be told:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#JdbcResolverIdentifierFunction">The database value corresponding to a given identifier</a></li>
  <li><a href="#JdbcResolverMediaTypeFunction">The media type corresponding to that value</a></li>
  <li><a href="#JdbcResolverBlobSQL">The SQL command that retrieves the BLOB corresponding to that value</a></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="JdbcResolverIdentifierFunction">Database Identifier Retrieval Function</h4>

<p>This JavaScript function takes in an unencoded identifier and returns the corresponding database value of the identifier. For example, the following will work when the identifiers in the URL map directly to values in the database:</p>

<pre><code>JdbcResolver.function.identifier = function getDatabaseIdentifier(url_identifier) {\
      return url_identifier;\
  }</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, if the URL identifiers require some transformation first:</p>

<pre><code>JdbcResolver.function.identifier = function getDatabaseIdentifier(url_identifier) {\
        // Assumes that the identifier is stored in the database as\
        // "identifier-something"\
        return url_identifier + "-something";\
    }</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-info">Note that in properties files, all lines in multi-line strings except the last need to end with a backslash (\).</div>

<h4 id="JdbcResolverMediaTypeFunction">Media Type Retrieval Function</h4>

<p>This JavaScript function returns a media (MIME) type corresponding to the value returned by the <code><a href="#JdbcResolverIdentifierFunction">getDatabaseIdentifier()</a></code> function. If the media type is stored in the database, this example will return an SQL statement to retrieve it.</p>

<pre><code>JdbcResolver.function.media_type = function getMediaType(identifier) {\
      return "SELECT media_type " +\
          "FROM some_table " +\
          "WHERE some_identifier = ?"\
  }</code></pre>

<p>If the URL identifier will <strong>always</strong> have a known, valid image extension, like <span class="filename">.jpg</span>, <span class="filename">.tif</span>, etc., the entire <code>JdbcResolver.function.media_type</code> option can be commented out, and Cantaloupe will infer the media type from the extension.</p>

<h4 id="JdbcResolverBlobSQL">BLOB Retrieval SQL</h4>

<p><code>JdbcResolver.lookup_sql</code> is an SQL statement that selects the BLOB corresponding to the value returned by the <code><a href="#JdbcResolverIdentifierFunction">getDatabaseIdentifier()</a></code> function.</p>

<pre><code>JdbcResolver.lookup_sql = SELECT image_blob_column \
    FROM some_table \
    WHERE some_identifier = ?</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3 id="AmazonS3Resolver">AmazonS3Resolver</h3>

<p>AmazonS3Resolver maps a URL identifier to an Amazon S3 object. The identifier is passed as-is to S3.</p>

<p>AmazonS3Resolver currently only supports images with recognizable filename extensions. For images with extensions that are missing or unrecognized, an HTTP 404 error will be returned.</p>

<p>AmazonS3Resolver can be configured with the following options:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>AmazonS3Resolver.access_key_id</code></dt>
  <dd>An access key associated with your AWS account. (See <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials">AWS Security Credentials</a>.)</dd>
  <dt><code>AmazonS3Resolver.secret_key</code></dt>
  <dd>A secret key associated with your AWS account. (See <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials">AWS Security Credentials</a>.)</dd>
  <dt><code>AmazonS3Resolver.bucket.name</code></dt>
  <dd>Name of the bucket containing the images to be served.</dd>
  <dt><code>AmazonS3Resolver.bucket.region</code></dt>
  <dd>Name of a region to send requests to, such as <code>us-east-1</code>. Can be commented out or left blank to use a default region. (See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region">S3 Regions</a>.)</dd>
