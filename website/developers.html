<h3 id="Resolvers">Custom Resolvers</h3>

<p>A resolver is a class that implements the <code>e.i.l.c.resolver.FileResolver</code>
and/or <code>e.i.l.c.resolver.StreamResolver</code> interfaces. Then, to use it, set <code>resolver</code> in your configuration file to its name.</p>

<p>See one of the existing resolvers for examples.</p>

<h3 id="Processors">Custom Image Processors</h3>

<p>A processor is a class that implements the <code>e.i.l.c.processor.FileProcessor</code>
and/or <code>e.i.l.c.processor.StreamProcessor</code> interfaces. See the interface documentation for details and the existing implementations for examples.</p>

<p>Another option might be to add an ImageIO format plugin instead of a custom processor; then it would work with Java2dProcessor or JaiProcessor.</p>

<h3 id="Caches">Custom Caches</h3>

<p>A cache is a class that implements the <code>e.i.l.c.cache.Cache</code> interface. See the interface documentation for details and the existing implementations for
examples.</p>
