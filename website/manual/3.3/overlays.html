<p>The overlay feature (called "watermarking" prior to version 3.3) overlays an image or text string on top of a derivative (output) image. This can be useful for description, branding, attribution, copyright notices, and so on.</p>

<p>As of version 3.3, overlay images can be located on the local filesystem or a web server. Regardless, they are cached in memory after being loaded the first time, so there is no performance penalty for using web-hosted overlay images.</p>

<h2 id="Modes of Operation">Modes of Operation</h2>

<p>The overlay system offers two "strategies," or modes of operation: a basic strategy, where overlay properties are hard-coded in the configuration file and applied to all requests; and a <a href="#ScriptStrategy">script strategy</a>, where the decision of whether to apply an overlay, and what kind, depends on the return value of a delegate method. The <code>overlays.strategy</code> configuration key is used to set the strategy.</p>

<h3 id="BasicStrategy">BasicStrategy</h3>

<p>With BasicStrategy, the <code>overlays.BasicStrategy.*</code> keys in the configuration file are used to set an overlay type (image or string), position, inset, and others. This strategy is easy to configure and is all that is needed when it is intended for the same overlay to be applied to all images.</p>

<h3 id="ScriptStrategy">ScriptStrategy</h3>

<p>Perhaps you only want to apply an image overlay to some of your images, and to others, you want to apply a string overlay, or no overlay. Perhaps you want to control overlays based on the client's IP address or user agent. Or, perhaps you only want to apply overlays to JPEG output images, and not GIFs. Or, perhaps you don't want to apply an overlay to images that have been rotated. All of this is possible by writing just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>With the <code>Cantaloupe::overlay()</code> delegate method, you can tell the image server whether to apply an overlay in response to a particular request, and what its properties should be. An example of how this can be accomplished appears below:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
module Cantaloupe
  ##
  # See the argument & return value documentation in delegates.rb.sample.
  #
  def self.overlay(identifier, operations, resulting_size, output_format,
                   request_uri, request_headers, client_ip, cookies)
    # If the resulting image is less than this many pixels on a side, don't
    # apply an overlay.
    min_size_cutoff = 300
    return false if resulting_size['width'] < min_size_cutoff or
        resulting_size['height'] < min_size_cutoff

    # Don't render an overlay for clients on localhost.
    return false if %w(127.0.0.1 ::1/128).include?(client_ip)

    # Don't render an overlay on GIF images.
    return false if output_format['media_type'] == 'image/gif'

    # Don't render an overlay on images of cantaloupes.
    return false if identifier.downcase.include?('cantaloupe')

    # Render an image overlay for iOS clients.
    if request_headers.
        select{ |k,v| k.downcase == 'user-agent' and v.include?('iOS') }.any?
      return {
        'pathname' => '/path/to/ios-overlay.png',
        'position' => 'bottom right',
        'inset' => 5
      }
    end

    # Render a string overlay for all other clients.
    {
      'string' => "This is totally dynamic\nAnd it has multiple lines",
      'position' => 'bottom left',
      'inset' => 5,
      'color' => 'red',
      'font' => 'Helvetica',
      'font_size' => 20,
      'font_weight' => 1.0,
      'stroke_color' => 'black',
      'stroke_width' => 1
    }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="Requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>An overlay must be a 24-bit PNG image, either RGB or RGBA.</p>

<p>When using multiple image overlays, their filenames must all be different, regardless of where they reside.</p>

<p><a href="images/overlay-sample.png">Sample overlay (PNG)</a></p>

<h2 id="Positioning">Positioning</h2>

<p>Position and inset are configurable. Supported positions are:</p>

<table class="table text-center">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>top left</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      <code>top center</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      <code>top right</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>left center</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      <code>center</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      <code>right center</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>bottom left</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      <code>bottom center</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      <code>bottom right</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>String overlay text is auto-aligned to the left, center, or right, depending on whether the position is to the left, center, or right, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="Processor Support">Processor Support</h2>

<p>Not all processors support overlays; see the <a href="processors.html#Supported%20Features">table of processor-supported features</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Implications">Implications</h2>

<h3 id="Performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Overlay application has minimal impact on response times, adding probably no more than a few milliseconds most of the time. One thing to note, though, is that normally, requests for source images with no modification are streamed through with no processing. When overlays are enabled, this will no longer be the case.</p>

<h3 id="Zooming Image Viewers">Zooming Image Viewers</h3>

<p>Zooming image viewers display a mosaic of cropped image tiles. When overlays are enabled, each tile will have one, which is bound to look strange.</p>

<p>One way of working around this might be to set the <code>overlays.BasicStrategy.output_width_threshold</code> and <code>overlays.BasicStrategy.output_height_threshold</code> configuration options to values that are slightly larger than the tile size used by the image viewer. This will disable overlays for images the size of image viewer tiles, and enable them for anything larger. Unfortunately, the tile size used by the viewer may differ depending on the source image, as the recommended tile sizes in <a href="endpoints.html">information responses</a> will vary on a per-image basis.</p>

<h3 id="Caching">Caching</h3>

<p>Overlay parameters (filename, position, inset, etc.) are encoded in cached-image identifiers. When overlay settings change, cached affected images will be re-generated automatically, and images with different overlay settings (when using <a href="#ScriptStrategy">ScriptStrategy</a>) will be cached separately.</p>
