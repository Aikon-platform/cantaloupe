Various processors support several other formats than those listed here; what follows are mainly just notes.</p>

<h2 id="JPEG">JPEG</h2>

<p>Java2dProcessor and JaiProcessor use the com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageReader class to read JPEGs. The performance of this reader can vary greatly from JRE to JRE.</p>

<h2 id="JPEG2000">JPEG2000</h2>

<p>JPEG2000 uses advanced compression techniques to enable fast reduced-scale and region-of-interest decoding. With a performant decoder, JPEG2000 is well-suited for use with very large source images.</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#KakaduProcessor">KakaduProcessor</a> is the most efficient processor for this format, and it performs very well, even with huge images. Unfortunately, Kakadu is not free.</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#OpenJpegProcessor">OpenJpegProcessor</a> uses the <a href="http://www.openjpeg.org">OpenJPEG</a> decoder, which is generally considered, as of this writing, to be the fastest open-source JPEG2000 decoder. (<a href="processors.html#ImageMagickProcessor">ImageMagickProcessor</a>'s JPEG2000 delegate, if installed, will also use the OpenJPEG library, but less efficiently as it won't use its region-extraction or level-reduction features.)</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#GraphicsMagickProcessor">GraphicsMagickProcessor</a> can read and write JPEG2000 using JasPer, if the necessary plugin is installed. This will probably not be fast enough to be usable for most purposes.</p>

<h2 id="TIFF">TIFF</h2>

<p>TIFF is a common format that most processors can read. However, there are some criteria that source images must meet in order to be delivered with best efficiency.</p>

<h3>Strip-Based vs. Tile-Based</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFF6.pdf">Adobe TIFF 6.0 specification</a> permits arrangements of image data in either strips or tiles. Most TIFF encoders produce strip-based TIFFs unless told to do otherwise. These are increasingly slow to read as their size increases. <strong>High-resolution TIFFs should be tile-based</strong> in order to permit efficient region extraction. An easy way to check is with the <span class="filename">tiffdump</span> utility:</p>

<pre>$ tiffdump image.tif</pre>

<p>For strip-based TIFFs, this will print out some information including <code>StripOffsets</code>, <code>StripByteCounts</code>, and so on. For tile-based TIFFs, it will print <code>TileOffsets</code>, <code>TileByteCounts</code>, and so on, instead.</p>

<h3>Multi-Resolution (Pyramidal) TIFF</h3>

<p>Multi-resolution TIFF is a special type of TIFF file that can be read more efficiently at reduced scales. In addition to the main image, a multi-resolution TIFF file will contain a sequence of progressively half-sized sub-images: for example, a 10000&times;10000 pixel main image would include derivatives of 5000&times;5000 pixels, 2500&times;2500 pixels, 1250&times;1250 pixels, and so on, all embedded in the same file.</p>

<p>Each of the levels in a multi-resolution TIFF file can be striped or tiled, just as in a mono-resolution file. Tiled and pyramidal encodings are complementary: the former improves efficiency with reduced regions at large scales, and the latter improves efficiency at reduced scales. For efficient deep zooming, TIFF images need to be pyramidal, and each level of the pyramid should be tiled.</p>

<h3>Processor Considerations</h3>

<p>To reiterate: most processors can "read the TIFF format," but not all can read it efficiently. Currently, <a href="processors.html#Java2dProcessor">Java2dProcessor</a> and <a href="processors.html#JaiProcessor">JaiProcessor</a> both support multi-resolution TIFF, which is to say that they actually do read the embedded sub-images and choose the smallest one that can fulfill the request. Additionally, both exploit tiled sub-images. JaiProcessor, however, is able to use the JAI processing pipeline to do this more efficiently, so it is currently the best-performing processor for suitably-encoded high-resolution TIFF images.</p>
