<h1>Upgrading</h1>

<p>(If you are skipping versions, it will be necessary to work through this list upwards from the version you are currently on.)</p>

<h2>From 2.1 to 2.1.1</h2>

<p>Nothing to do.</p>

<h2>From 2.0 to 2.1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add the following keys from the sample configuration:
    <ul>
      <li><code>JaiProcessor.*</code></li>
      <li><code>Java2dProcessor.tif.compression</code></li>
      <li><code>FilesystemCache.dir.*</code></li>
      <li><code>log.*.SyslogAppender.*</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add the <code>authorized?</code> method from the sample delegate script.</li>
  <li>Purge your cache.</li>
</ul>

<h2>From 1.x to 2.0</h2>

<p>There are so many new and renamed configuration keys in this version that it is recommended to start over with a new configuration file. The inline comments, which serve as the primary source of configuration documentation, have also been updated.</p>

<p>Also, because the cache naming format has changed, it will be necessary to purge your cache before using this version.</p>
