<h2>Access Control</h2>

<h3 id="Authentication">Authentication</h3>

<p>Cantaloupe has built-in support for HTTP Basic authentication. To enable it, set the following keys in the configuration file:</p>

{% highlight properties %}
auth.basic.enabled = true
auth.basic.username = myusername
auth.basic.secret = mypassword
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When enabled, the entire website will be restricted.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">HTTP Basic transmits passwords in clear text, so it should only be used on a trusted local network, or in conjunction with <a href="deployment.html#SSL%2FTLS">TLS</a>.</div>

<p>A reverse proxy server can be used to support other means of authentication.</p>

<h3 id="Authorization">Authorization</h3>

<p>Currently, Cantaloupe is not authorization-aware. But, <a href="https://github.com/medusa-project/cantaloupe/issues/22">stay tuned</a>.</p>
