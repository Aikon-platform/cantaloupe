<p>Cantaloupe is an open-source image server enabling on-demand derivative generation from high-resolution source images. With available processing operations including cropping, scaling, and rotation, it can support deep-zooming image viewers, as well as on-the-fly thumbnail generation. Compliance with the <a href="http://iiif.io/">IIIF Image API</a> enables it to work with <a href="http://iiif.io/apps-demos/">a growing number of client applications</a>.</p>
