<h2 id="About">About</h2>

<p>Cantaloupe is an open-source image server developed at the <a href="http://www.library.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library</a>. By combining the basic operations of cropping, scaling, rotation, flipping, color filtering, and format conversion, it can support on-the-fly derivative image generation and deep zooming into high-resolution source images.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/">IIIF Image API</a> is an open standard intended to promote interoperability between clients &mdash; like zooming image viewers &mdash; and image servers. Cantaloupe itself and most of its processors meet the highest possible compliance level, and should work with any IIIF-compatible client software, including <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io">OpenSeadragon</a>, Mirador, and so on.</p>

<p>Cantaloupe features a configurable processing pipeline based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="resolvers.html">Resolvers</a>, that locate source images;</li>
  <li><a href="processors.html">Processors</a>, that transform them according to the parameters in an image request; and</li>
  <li><a href="caches.html">Caches</a>, that cache generated images.</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes it adaptable, while remaining easy to configure and use.</p>
