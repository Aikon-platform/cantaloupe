*[IIIF 2.0](http://iiif.io) image server in Java*

Cantaloupe is an extensible IIIF 2.0 image server written in Java. It uses the
[Restlet](http://restlet.com/products/restlet-framework/) REST framework on top
of the [Simple](http://www.simpleframework.org) high-performance HTTP server.

# Features

* Simple
* Easy to get working
* Pluggable resolvers for filesystem and HTTP sources
* Pluggable processors for different source image formats

## What It Doesn't Do

* Caching. This would be made redundant by a caching reverse proxy like
  Varnish, which can do a better job anyway.

# Requirements

The only hard requirement is JRE 7+. Additional requirements depend on your
choice of processor; see the Processors section below.

# Configuration

Create a file called `cantaloupe.properties` anywhere on disk and paste into
it the following contents, modifying as desired:

    # TCP port to bind the web server to.
    http.port = 8182

    # Helpful in development
    print_stack_trace_on_error_pages = true

    # The image processor to use for various source formats. Available values
    # are `ImageIoProcessor`, `GraphicsMagickProcessor`, and
    # `ImageMagickProcessor`.
    processor.jp2 = ImageMagickProcessor
    processor.jpg = ImageIoProcessor
    processor.tif = ImageMagickProcessor
    # Fall back to a general-purpose processor that supports just about
    # everything.
    processor.fallback = ImageMagickProcessor

    # Optional; overrides the PATH
    GraphicsMagickProcessor.path_to_binaries = /usr/local/bin

    # Optional; overrides the PATH
    ImageMagickProcessor.path_to_binaries = /usr/local/bin
    
    # The path resolver that translates the identifier in the URL to a path.
    # Available values are `FilesystemResolver` and `HttpResolver`.
    resolver = FilesystemResolver

    # The server-side path that will be prefixed to the identifier in the
    # request URL.
    FilesystemResolver.path_prefix = /home/myself/images
    # The server-side path or extension. that will be suffixed to the identifier
    # in the request URL.
    FilesystemResolver.path_suffix =
    
    # The URL that will be prefixed to the identifier in the request URL.
    HttpResolver.url_prefix = http://localhost/images/
    # The path, extension, query string, etc. that will be suffixed to the
    # identifier in the request URL.
    HttpResolver.url_suffix =
    # Used for HTTP Basic authentication
    HttpResolver.username =
    HttpResolver.password =

# Running

Run it like:

`$ java -jar Cantaloupe-x.x.x.jar -Dcantaloupe.config=/path/to/cantaloupe.properties`

It is now ready for use at: `http://localhost:{http.port}/iiif/`

# Processors

Cantaloupe can use different image processors, each of which can be assigned to
particular source formats via the config file (see the Configuration section
above). Currently, available processors include:

* ImageIoProcessor
* GraphicsMagickProcessor
* ImageMagickProcessor

## ImageIoProcessor

ImageIoProcessor uses the Java ImageIO interface to load and operate on
BufferedImages.

ImageIO, as its name implies, is simply an I/O interface that does not know
anything about image formats, and therefore the list of formats supported by
this processor varies depending on platform and the available libraries (jars)
in the classpath. By default, it is minimal -- typically something like JPEG,
GIF, and PNG.

## GraphicsMagickProcessor

GraphicsMagickProcessor uses [im4java](http://im4java.sourceforge.net) to
fork out to the GraphicsMagick shell command (`gm`). As such,
GraphicsMagick must be installed.

GraphicsMagick produces high-quality output and supports all of the IIIF
transforms and all IIIF output formats except WebP (assuming the necessary
libraries are installed; see [Supported Formats]
(http://www.graphicsmagick.org/formats.html)).

GraphicsMagickProcessor is a good fallback processor as it supports a wide
range of formats and is generally faster than ImageMagickProcessor. As with any
processor, performance degrades and memory usage increases as image size and
traffic increase.

## ImageMagickProcessor

ImageMagickProcessor, like GraphicsMagickProcessor, also uses
[im4java](http://im4java.sourceforge.net) to wrap ImageMagick commands.

ImageMagick produces high-quality output and supports all of the IIIF
transforms and all IIIF output formats except WebP (assuming the JPEG2000 and
PDF delegates are installed).

ImageMagick is not known for being particularly fast or efficient. Performance
degrades and memory usage increases as image size increases. Large amounts of
RAM and fast storage help.

The ImageMagickProcessor requires ImageMagick to be installed, as well as its
PDF and JPEG2000 delegates.

# Resolvers

## FilesystemResolver

FilesystemResolver maps an identifier from an IIIF URL to a filesystem path
for retrieving images from a local filesystem.

### Example With Prefix Only

Given the following configuration options:

* `FilesystemResolver.path_prefix = /data/images/`
* `FilesystemResolver.path_suffix = `

And the following URL:

* http://example.org/iiif/image.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg

FilesystemResolver will look for an image located at
/data/images/image.jpg.

### Example With Prefix and Suffix

Given the following configuration options:

* `FilesystemResolver.path_prefix = /data/images/`
* `FilesystemResolver.path_suffix = /image.jp2`

And the following URL:

* http://example.org/iiif/some-uuid/full/full/0/default.jpg

FilesystemResolver will look for an image located at
/data/images/some-uuid/image.jp2.

## HttpResolver

HttpResolver maps an identifier from an IIIF URL to some other URL, for
retrieving images from a web server.

### Example With Prefix Only

Given the following configuration options:

* `HttpResolver.url_prefix = http://localhost/images/`
* `HttpResolver.url_suffix = `

And the following URL:

* http://example.org/iiif/image.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg

HttpResolver will look for an image located at
http://localhost/images/image.jpg.

### Example With Prefix and Suffix

Given the following configuration options:

* `HttpResolver.url_prefix = http://localhost/images/`
* `HttpResolver.url_suffix = /image.jp2`

And the following URL:

* http://example.org/iiif/some-uuid/full/full/0/default.jpg

HttpResolver will look for an image located at
http://localhost/images/some-uuid/image.jp2.

# Feedback

Ideas, suggestions, feature requests, bug reports, and so on are welcome;
please either create an issue, or
[contact the author](mailto:alexd@illinois.edu).

# Custom Development

## Adding Custom Resolvers

Resolvers are easy to write: all you have to do is write a class that
implements the
`edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.resolver.Resolver` interface. Then, to use it,
set `resolver` in your properties file to its name.

Feel free to add new configuration keys to the properties file. They should
be in the form of `NameOfMyResolver.whatever`. They can then be accessed
via `edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.Application.getConfiguration()`.

See one of the existing resolvers for examples.

## Adding Custom Image Processors

Processors implement the `edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.processor.Processor`
interface. See the interface documentation for details and the existing
implementations for examples.
