# üçà Cantaloupe

*[IIIF 2.0](http://iiif.io) image server in Java*

Cantaloupe is an IIIF 2.0 image server written in Java. It uses the
[Restlet](http://restlet.com/products/restlet-framework/) REST framework and
the [Simple](http://www.simpleframework.org) high-performance HTTP server.

# Features

* Simple
* Easy to get working
* Pluggable resolvers for filesystem and HTTP sources
* Pluggable processors for different source image formats (currently, an
  ImageMagick processor supports quite a few)

## Missing Features

* Caching. A caching reverse proxy can do a better job.
* Log file writing. Log messages go to standard output.

# Requirements

* JRE 7+
* ImageMagick with PDF and JPEG2000 delegates (see the ImageMagickProcessor
  section below)

# Configuration

Create a file called `cantaloupe.properties` anywhere on disk and paste into
it the following contents, modifying as desired:

    # TCP port to bind to the web server.
    http.port = 8182

    # Helpful in development
    print_stack_trace_on_error_page = true

    # The image processor to use for various source formats. The only
    # available value for any of these, currently, is `ImageMagickProcessor`.
    processor.jp2 = ImageMagickProcessor
    processor.jpg = ImageMagickProcessor
    processor.tif = ImageMagickProcessor
    # Fall back to a general-purpose processor that supports just about
    # everything.
    processor.fallback = ImageMagickProcessor

    # Optional; overrides the PATH
    ImageMagickProcessor.path_to_binaries = /usr/local/bin
    
    # The path resolver that translates the identifier in the URL to a path.
    # Available values are `FilesystemResolver` and `HttpResolver`.
    resolver = FilesystemResolver
    
    # The server-side path that will be prefixed to the identifier in the
    # request URL.
    FilesystemResolver.path_prefix = /home/myself/images
    
    # The server-side path or extension. that will be suffixed to the identifier
    # in the request URL.
    FilesystemResolver.path_suffix =
    
    # The URL that will be prefixed to the identifier in the request URL.
    HttpResolver.url_prefix = http://localhost/images/
    
    # The path, extension, query string, etc. that will be suffixed to the
    # identifier in the request URL.
    HttpResolver.url_suffix =

    # Used for HTTP Basic authentication
    HttpResolver.username =
    HttpResolver.password =

# Running

Run it like:

`$ java -jar Cantaloupe-x.x.x.jar -Dcantaloupe.config=/path/to/cantaloupe.properties`

It is now ready for use at: `http://localhost:{http.port}/iiif/`

# Processors

Cantaloupe can use different image processors. Currently, it includes only the
ImageMagickProcessor.

## ImageMagickProcessor

ImageMagickProcessor uses [im4java](http://im4java.sourceforge.net), which
forks out to the ImageMagick `convert` and `identify` shell commands, which
must be present in the PATH.

ImageMagick produces high-quality output and supports all of the IIIF
transforms and all IIIF output formats except WebP (assuming the JPEG2000 and
PDF delegates are installed).

ImageMagick is not known for being particularly fast or efficient. Performance
degrades and memory usage increases as image size increases. Large amounts of
RAM and fast storage help.

# Resolvers

## FilesystemResolver

FilesystemResolver maps an identifier from an IIIF URL to a filesystem path
for retrieving images from a local filesystem.

### Example With Prefix Only

Given the following configuration options:

* `FilesystemResolver.path_prefix = /data/images/`
* `FilesystemResolver.path_suffix = `

And the following URL:

* http://example.org/iiif/image.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg

FilesystemResolver will look for an image located at
/data/images/image.jpg.

### Example With Prefix and Suffix

Given the following configuration options:

* `FilesystemResolver.path_prefix = /data/images/`
* `FilesystemResolver.path_suffix = /image.jp2`

And the following URL:

* http://example.org/iiif/some-uuid/full/full/0/default.jpg

FilesystemResolver will look for an image located at
/data/images/some-uuid/image.jp2.

## HttpResolver

HttpResolver maps an identifier from an IIIF URL to some other URL, for
retrieving images from a web server.

### Example With Prefix Only

Given the following configuration options:

* `HttpResolver.url_prefix = http://localhost/images/`
* `HttpResolver.url_suffix = `

And the following URL:

* http://example.org/iiif/image.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg

HttpResolver will look for an image located at
http://localhost/images/image.jpg.

### Example With Prefix and Suffix

Given the following configuration options:

* `HttpResolver.url_prefix = http://localhost/images/`
* `HttpResolver.url_suffix = /image.jp2`

And the following URL:

* http://example.org/iiif/some-uuid/full/full/0/default.jpg

HttpResolver will look for an image located at
http://localhost/images/some-uuid/image.jp2.

# Custom Development

## Adding Custom Resolvers

Resolvers are easy to write. All you have to do is implement the simple
`edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.resolver.Resolver` interface.

To use your custom resolver, set `resolver` in your properties file to its
class name.

Feel free to add new configuration keys to the properties file. They should
be in the form of `NameOfMyResolver.whatever`. They can then be accessed
via `edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.Application.getConfiguration()`.

See one of the existing resolvers for examples.

## Adding Custom Image Processors

Processors implement the `edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.processor.Processor`
interface. See the interface documentation for details and
`ImageMagickProcessor` for an example.
