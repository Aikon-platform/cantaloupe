  ##
  # Tells the server whether the given request is authorized. Will be called
  # upon all image requests to any endpoint.
  #
  # Implementations should assume that the underlying resource is available.
  #
  # @param identifier [String] Image identifier
  # @param full_size [Hash<String,Integer>] Hash with "width" and "height"
  #                                         keys corresponding to the pixel
  #                                         dimensions of the source image.
  # @param operations [Array<Hash<String,Object>] Array of operations in order
  #                   of execution. Only operations that are not no-ops will
  #                   be included. Every hash contains an "operation" key
  #                   corresponding to the type of operation. See the Javadoc
  #                   of e.i.l.c.image.Operation implementations for a list of

  #                       keys corresponding to the pixel dimensions of the
  #                       resulting image after all operations are applied.
  # @param output_format [Hash<String,String>] Hash with "media_type" and
  #                                            "extension" keys.
  # @param request_uri [String] Full request URI
  # @param request_headers [Hash<String,String>]
  # @param client_ip [String]
  # @param cookies [Hash<String,String>]
  # @return [Boolean] Whether the request is authorized based on the supplied
  #                   parameters.
